Bellabeat Case Study: Consumer Fitness Trends
This project analyzes smart fitness tracker data to uncover behavioral trends that can inform marketing strategies for Bellabeat, a wellness technology company focused on women's health. The case study is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone.

Dataset
The dataset contains daily activity data collected from Fitbit users between April and May 2016. It includes metrics such as steps, distances, calories burned, and activity intensity levels. The data is publicly available on Kaggle.

Tools and Technologies
R programming language
R packages: tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, janitor
Notebook environment: R Markdown (Kaggle Notebooks)

Project Summary
The analysis reveals that users walk an average of 7,638 steps per day and burn approximately 2,304 calories. There is a strong positive correlation between total steps and calories burned, while light activity and sedentary time show minimal impact on total energy expenditure.

Key Insights
Users with 10,000+ steps consistently burn over 2,500 calories per day.

Most users log low "very active minutes," suggesting room for increased engagement.

Steps and calories are the strongest correlated indicators of physical activity.

Recommendations for Bellabeat
Emphasize step-based goals and active minutes in the app experience.

Add gamification elements around very active minutes to promote higher intensity activity.

Target high-engagement users for retention and refer-a-friend campaigns.
